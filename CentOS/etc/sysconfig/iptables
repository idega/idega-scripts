# Implementations of the Internet Protocol Suite include 
# a virtual network interface through which network applications 
# can communicate when executing on the same machine. 
# It is implemented entirely within the operating system's networking 
# software and passes no packets to any network interface controller. 
# Any traffic that a computer program sends to a loopback IP address 
# is simply and immediately passed back up the network software stack 
# as if it had been received from another device.
