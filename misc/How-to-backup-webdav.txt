Here is how I managed to mount webdav(slide) on linux (probably can be done with macfuse as well).
The purpose for me is to be able to back up the slide file systems.

Download these:
wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/fuse/fuse-2.7.4.tar.gz
wget http://www.webdav.org/neon/neon-0.28.3.tar.gz
wget http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/dav/davfs2-1.3.3.tar.gz

tar -xvf the archives

then regular build from the sources:
./configure
make
make install

Then add the user dav2fs and group
groupadd davfs2
useradd -g davfs2 davfs2

If you are using another user than root you need use fstab otherwise you can just create a folder for the webdav mount
mkdir idega.is
and the mount command is like this (will ask for user and password)
mount.davfs http://www.idega.is/content/files/ idega.is

Then you are done, now you can browse, copy, move like you wish from the idega.is folder

unmount by :
unmount.davfs2 idega.is

-Eiki
